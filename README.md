# HTML Class Session 2 - Basic Concepts

This repository includes my learning notes and example code from **HTML Class Session 2**, taken online with **Instructor Hafizullah Khokhar** via Kohaq.

## Topics Covered

- **Semantic HTML Tags**  
  Explored tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, and `<div>` to structure web content meaningfully and improve readability.

- **HTML Attributes**  
  Learned important attributes such as `href` (for links), `src` and `alt` (for images) that enhance website functionality and accessibility.

- **Creating Links and Embedding Images**  
  Practiced using `<a>` to create hyperlinks and `<img>` to insert images, following best practices for accessibility.

- **Lists for Content Organization**  
  Worked with ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, using `<li>` elements to organize information clearly.

## Purpose

These fundamentals form the foundation for building clean, accessible, and well-structured web pages. This repository serves as a reference and practice guide for beginners learning HTML.
